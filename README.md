  Simple weatherApi Ejs app with Bodyparser, Express
</h3>

## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

As part of my studies on **[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp)**, I developed an app that makes API calls to **[Openweather](https://openweathermap.org/)** using BodyParser, Express, and EJS.

The project originally handled API responses with res.write(), but I enhanced it by adding Bootstrap 5 for styling and EJS for better handling of potential user input errors like typos. I styled the app with a sleek, transparent design over a pretty background, making it a great standalone project. In the future, I plan to rebuild it with React and React Native, including a 5-day forecast feature for added functionality at the click of a button.

</div>

Key Features:

- **API Integration** - Fetches weather data from OpenWeather using BodyParser and Express.
- **Dynamic UI** - Displays results dynamically with EJS, allowing for personalized content.
- **Error Handling** Manages input errors (e.g., typos) for smoother user experience.
- **Aesthetic Styling**: Features a transparent, visually appealing background.
