  Simple weatherApi app 
  <br>
  Bodyparser, Express with Ejs
</h3>

## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

<p>As part of my studies on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Udemy</a>, I developed an app that makes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API</a> calls to <a href="https://openweathermap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Openweather</a> using BodyParser, Express, and EJS. </p> 
<p>The project originally handled API responses with res.write(), but I enhanced it by adding Bootstrap 5 for styling and EJS for better handling of potential user input errors like typos. I styled the app with a sleek, transparent design over a pretty background, making it a great standalone project. In the future, I plan to rebuild it with React and React Native, including a 5-day forecast feature for added functionality at the click of a button.</p>

<p> 
Key Features: 
  <li>API Integration - Fetches weather data from OpenWeather using BodyParser and Express.
  </li> <li>Dynamic UI - Displays results dynamically with EJS, allowing for personalized content.
  </li> <li>Error Handling: Manages input errors (e.g., typos) for smoother user experience. </li> 
  <li>Aesthetic Styling: Features a transparent, visually appealing background. </li> </p>
