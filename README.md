  Simple openweathermap.org weatherApi app 
  <br>
  Express with Ejs
</h3>

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This app was part of the lecture I followed on Udemy. I felt fascinated by using EJS with MongoDb the user could interact with the App and send their own post to a database, which gets displayed once the page gets refreashed. Altough it is a simple App, for me did worth more so I redisigned it and added some @medias for small devices. I think it could be a good start for beginner trying to build similar applications. 

Take care, code safe! ðŸ’»
